## About me:
For the last two years I was a Team Leader in an e-commerce company that is the creator of the Shoper software. I worked in the newly created department of Shoper Payments, which required constant development. Therefore, there were errors and problems, but thanks to reporting them in JIRA and regular meetings with the IT team, we managed to solve them quickly. The experience I gained made me want to learn and develop in the field of testing, which is why I decided to take a tester course and get the ISTQB certificate. My determination and enthusiasm for learning helped me gain knowledge in this field. I want to continue my career as a tester to develop my skills and help create even better products. I am ready for new challenges and expanding knowledge about testing.
